# CharacterArt-Challenge

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Blender or equivalent

## The Problem

We have a stadium event that should give users the chance to custom their avatars and match with the event. 

For this piece we would like to start work on a military outfit, beginning with a pair of military boots which will for part of a larger cosmetic in the style of ready player me.

These will need to be modelled and textured in your preferred tools (Blender is bonus) and brought to Unreal for rendering, lighting, finally submission.

Weâ€™ve included full body male avatar template files and a sample avatar as a starting point and reference.

## The Goal

The goal of this test is to show your ability to take an existing style and extrapolate that for cosmetics. This is also intended as an opportunity for you to showcase your hard & soft surface modelling, retopology, and texturing capabilities.


This is not intended to be ready for use in app, but visually it should match the art style and to be ready for the next art pipeline phase.

The total time spent on this test should be no more than 2 days.

## Requirements

- Submitted as an fbx, glb/gltf or equivalent 3D file format
- Clean topology
